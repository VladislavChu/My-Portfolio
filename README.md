# Good day! My name is Vdasilav Chudaev and I want tell you about me and my skills. #

I'm 24 years old, live in St. Petersburg, have wife and cat.
I was born in Blagoveshchensk. I received my bachelor's degree from Amur State University majoring in Tourism. In my last year of study, I realized that I did not want to work in my specialty and therefore began to look for work in another field.

Now I work as the head of the direct sales department in a telecom company. But I feel that this job does not give me pleasure, so I decided to get a new in-demand specialty with the help of online courses. At the moment I am studying on the Netology platform as a QA engineer. Over the past 2 months, I have been studying on the Netology platform as a QA engineer.

At the moment, I have already managed to learn and put into practice the following knowledge:

1. Methods and types of testing
2. Fundamentals of client-server interaction
3. Test design
4. Testing artifacts: test documentation, defects
5. Documentation testing tools (Jira Software)
6. Software development life cycle. Agile software development methodologies
7. HTML & CSS
8. GIT & GITHUB
9. Postman, JMeter

The next step I will study Java and Test Automation, and then wait for me on Google! (;
